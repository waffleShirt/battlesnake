BattleSnake CS Notes

New Project -> ASP.NET Core -> Next -> Settings -> Create -> API -> Create
Controllers Folder -> Add new controller -> API Controller with read/write (for template code)
Remove api/ from route
Create the 4 required endpoints /start /move /end /ping

Implement /ping first. All it has to do is return a 200 response (IactionResult with helper function Ok())
